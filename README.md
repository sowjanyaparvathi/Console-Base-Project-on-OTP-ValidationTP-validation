📧 OTP Email Sender & Verifier
This Python script automates the process of sending OTPs (One-Time Passwords) to a list of email recipients and verifies the entered OTP for authentication purposes.

🔧 Features
Sends unique 4-digit OTPs to each email address using Gmail SMTP.

Uses secure app passwords for Gmail login.

Stores and verifies OTPs entered by users.

Simple input-based verification for demonstration.

Clean and modular code, easily extendable for web or GUI integration.

📜 How It Works
The script reads a list of recipient email addresses.

For each recipient:

A random 4-digit OTP is generated.

The OTP is emailed using the Gmail SMTP server.

The script prompts the user to enter:

Their email address

The OTP they received

If the entered OTP matches the one sent to that email, verification is successful.

🔐 Security Note
Use an App Password for Gmail, not your main Gmail password.

Store credentials securely using environment variables or .env files (e.g., with the python-dotenv library).

🛠 Requirements
Python 3.x

Internet connection

A Gmail account with App Passwords enabled

▶ How to Run
bash

📌 Future Improvements
Add a web-based OTP input form

Store OTPs in a database for multi-user verification

Add email sending limits and logging for better control
